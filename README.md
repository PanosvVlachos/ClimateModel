# ClimateModel
In this project we are studying the a special climate model, the Budyko-Sellers model. This model belongs to the class of Energy Balance Models(EBM) and is of particular interest not only because of the intricate mathematics it involves but also due to its impressive performance despite its simplicity. 

The Budyko-Sellers model is capable of predicting various phenomena, including the Ice-Albedo Positive Feedback, the Milankovitch Orbital Cycles, and the Snowball Earth hypothesis. In this manner, by tuning system parameters—such as the insolation function or the albedo—to reflect different periods in Earth's history, we are able to reproduce the phenomena in question.
